In modern software development, accurate estimation of project size and effort is important for successful planning and execution. Recognizing the challenges regarding this process, we started on the development of a Function Point Calculator App. Motivated by the desire to identify project estimation practices and empower development teams with a reliable tool, this project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly application. Our objectives focus on the creation of a user-friendly interface for inputting project details, accurate calculation algorithms coping with industry standards, and customization options to provide diverse project requirements. By providing a comprehensive solution that facilitates accurate function point analysis, our vision is seeking to enhance project management practices and contribute to the efficiency and success of software development methods.
